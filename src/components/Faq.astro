      "A regular account is free and allows you to create and share your own lists. A premium account allows you to create and share your own lists, but also gives you access to premium lists created by other users. Premium lists are lists that are not free to access and require a premium account to view. Premium lists are usually more detailed and have more information than regular lists.",
